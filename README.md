# 3d-Galaxy-HackClub-Website

3D website starter built over the span of around 30-40 hours for Lambert's Hack Club using React, Tailwind CSS, and Three.js.  

Note: the website pages don't actually have anything on them because I'm not sure if you guys want to still use the original Hack Club website's UI for the pages and I don't actually have access to the repo so it wouldn't be that efficient. Also I ran out of time.
